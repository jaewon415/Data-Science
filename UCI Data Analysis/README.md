#This is the README.md for this repository

## Brief Information

This repository contains R code for getting and cleaning a data to generate a tidy data. The code in **run_analysis.R** file provides great example for creating a tidy data from test/train/validate dataset. 

## Code/Library brief explanation

Use library(data.table) and library(dplyr) to use function such as dcast/melt/select in the **run_analysis.R**. I originally thought that dplyr library will be used for select function, but decided to take out from the file to take advantage of practicing different function.

## Motivation

The R script was created for my programming assignment for coursera website, provided by John's Hopkins University.

## Installation

One should note/check if they have downloaded **data.table** and **dplyr** package before running the R script.

## Data Collected

I did not collect the data for this assignment. All the contribution goes to the website: "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" (Also contains all information about the dataset and it's purpose)

## Information about Variable

Please take time to read over the codebook.md in this repository
